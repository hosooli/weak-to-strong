## üéØ Implementation Highlights

### ‚úÖ Three-Way Dataset Splitting
```python
# Ground truth (40%), preference (40%), held-out (20%)
split1 = train_dataset.train_test_split(test_size=0.6, seed=seed)
ground_truth_ds = split1["train"]
remaining_ds = split1["test"]

split2 = remaining_ds.train_test_split(test_size=0.33, seed=seed)
preference_ds = split2["train"] 
held_out_ds = split2["test"]
```

### ‚úÖ RNN-Based Reward Model
```python
class RNNRewardModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_size=128, num_layers=2, history_length=10):
        self.input_projection = nn.Linear(4, hidden_size)  # trajectory features
        self.rnn = nn.LSTM(hidden_size, hidden_size, num_layers, batch_first=True)
        self.reward_head = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)
```

**Features tracked:**
- Per-token log probabilities (chosen vs rejected)
- Length differences between responses
- Confidence differences
- Historical trajectory patterns

### ‚úÖ Preference Learning with Weak Model
```python
def create_preference_pairs(weak_model, dataset, tokenizer, max_ctx, n_pairs=1000):
    # Uses weak model to create chosen/rejected pairs
    # Handles deceptive scenarios where weak model disagrees with ground truth
    # Creates synthetic preference data for RLAIF training
```

### ‚úÖ PPO-Based RL Training
```python
class PPOTrainer:
    def __init__(self, policy_model, reward_model, ref_model, ...):
        # Implements Proximal Policy Optimization
        # Includes value function estimation
        # Handles preference-based rewards
        # Supports online learning and adaptation
```

### ‚úÖ Deception Detection
```python
class DeceptionDetector:
    def detect_deception_signals(self):
        # Confidence-inconsistency detection
        # Prediction oscillation patterns
        # Confidence drop analysis
        # Returns deception likelihood scores
```

## üöÄ Three-Stage Training Process

### Stage 1: Ground Truth Training
- Train both weak and strong models on the same ground truth data (40% of dataset)
- Ensures fair baseline comparison
- Prevents distribution shift between models

### Stage 2: Preference Generation  
- Use weak model to generate preference pairs on held-out data (40% of dataset)
- Create chosen/rejected scenarios based on weak model predictions
- Identify potential deception patterns when weak model disagrees with ground truth

### Stage 3: RLAIF Training
- Train strong model using PPO with RNN-based reward model
- Reward model considers trajectory history for partial observability
- Online adaptation to changing supervision quality
- Deception mitigation through pattern recognition

## üîß Key Features Implemented

### Partial Observability Handling
- **RNN State Tracking**: Maintains hidden states across trajectories
- **Belief State Updates**: Tracks uncertainty in supervision quality  
- **Historical Context**: Uses sequence of past decisions for current rewards

### Deception Mitigation Strategies
- **Trajectory-Aware Rewards**: RNN considers sequence of decisions
- **Confidence Analysis**: Detects high-confidence incorrect predictions
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies oscillating or inconsistent behavior
- **Adaptive Weighting**: Reduces impact of uncertain supervision

### Advanced RL Components
- **PPO Implementation**: Stable policy optimization with clipping
- **Value Function**: Separate value head for advantage estimation
- **Entropy Regularization**: Prevents policy collapse
